# OVERVIEW AND PROJECT EXPLANATION
The dataset used for this project is gotten from Kaggle official website and the project is about predicting the quality of air based on some factors.
The factors required to predict the air quality index include:
    1. PM10 in æg/m3
    2. SO2 in æg/m3
    3. NOx  in æg/m3
    4. PM2.5  in æg/m3
    5. Ammonia - NH3  in æg/m3
    6. O3   in æg/m3
    7. CO  in mg/m3
    8. Benzene  in æg/m3

Extensive Exploratory analysis is done on these factors and their values and Some Interesting insights were discovered, some of them include:
    1. Benzene and SO2 have a correlation of 0.6992
    2. Benzene and O3 have a positive correlation of 0.68
    3. CO and PM2 have a correlation 0.562
    4. SO2 and O3 have a positive correlation of 0.509
